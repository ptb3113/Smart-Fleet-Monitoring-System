# 🚗 Smart Fleet Monitoring System

## 🌟 Overview
The **Smart Fleet Monitoring System** is designed to provide real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance insights for a fleet of vehicles. This project utilizes vehicle health data to build machine learning models that predict maintenance needs, optimize fleet performance, and minimize downtime. Through a combination of advanced data processing, predictive analytics, and interactive dashboards, the system empowers fleet managers to make informed decisions and maintain the health of their fleet effectively.

## 🚀 Features
- **🔍 Data Processing:**
  - Load, clean, and preprocess vehicle health data to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis and modeling.
  - Store and manage the processed data efficiently using an SQLite database for quick access and retrieval.

- **🤖 Predictive Modeling:**
  - Develop and evaluate machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Regressor (SVR), to predict vehicle component failures and maintenance needs.
  - Create new features, such as interaction terms and vehicle age, to improve model accuracy and predictive power.

- **🛠️ Preventive Maintenance:**
  - Implement predictive maintenance strategies to reduce unexpected vehicle breakdowns and optimize maintenance schedules.
  - Set up automated processes to retrain the machine learning models as new data becomes available, ensuring continued accuracy over time.

- **📊 Data Visualization:**
  - Create dynamic and interactive dashboards using Plotly and Dash to visualize vehicle health metrics, maintenance predictions, and fleet performance.
  - Provide real-time insights into the fleet's health, allowing managers to monitor critical metrics and take immediate action when necessary.

- **🖥️ System Monitoring:**
  - Monitor system performance, including CPU, memory, and disk usage, to ensure the system runs smoothly and efficiently.
  - Set up logging and alert mechanisms to track system metrics and notify managers of any potential issues.

- **🔄 Continuous Improvement:**
  - Gather and incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the system and adapt to the evolving needs of fleet management.
  - Regularly optimize the system based on performance data and user feedback to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

- **💾 SQL Integration:**
  - Utilize SQL for managing and querying vehicle health data stored in the SQLite database, enabling fast and efficient data retrieval and analysis.
